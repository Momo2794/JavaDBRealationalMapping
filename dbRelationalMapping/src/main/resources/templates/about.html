        <h1>About this Project</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This Project is just a example to show how Relational Mapping works in Java Spring Boot</p>
        <p>The Project was build with the IDE Intellij Community Edition, Java 11, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf,
            JPA Hibernate and the embedded Relational Database H2. </p>
        <p>Doesn't mean that other DB Engines can't be used in this project. I only used a embedded H2 Database so that
        an installation isn't needed.</p>
        <p>Like mentioned this Project gives an example how to use Relational Mapping in Java Spring Boot. You can see
        the whole Data either in the h2-console or by using 'localhost:8080/list-data/all' in a browser which shows
        you the data as JSON. There is also a example for a Login and a Listing of Data in a Table by using Thymeleaf.</p>
